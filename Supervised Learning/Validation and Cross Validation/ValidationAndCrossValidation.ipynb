    "<b> Measuring the model success again on the data used to develop the model may not give us reliable results. We have already found the model using this data.

    "The general practice is to divide the data we have into two and test the model we developed with the second one while developing the model with the first one. These two models are called the learning set (traning set) and the validation set (test set). Although it is not a general rule, 70% or 80% of the main data is 20% or 30% of the learning cluster is called the validation cluster. For a healthy model development, the learning and validation clusters must be randomly divided.</b>\n",
